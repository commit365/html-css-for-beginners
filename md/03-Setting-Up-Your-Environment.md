# Lesson 3: Setting Up Your Environment

## Choosing a Code Editor

A code editor is a crucial tool for writing and managing your HTML, CSS, and other web development code. Choosing the right code editor can enhance your productivity and make coding more enjoyable. Here are a couple of popular options:

### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- **Features**: VSCode is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, debugging, and Git integration.
- **Extensions**: It has a rich ecosystem of extensions that add functionality, such as live server, Emmet, and Prettier for code formatting.
- **Customization**: Highly customizable with themes and settings to suit your preferences.

### Sublime Text
- **Features**: Sublime Text is a lightweight, fast code editor known for its speed and simplicity. It supports multiple programming languages and offers syntax highlighting and code snippets.
- **Customization**: Offers a wide range of plugins and themes to enhance functionality and appearance.
- **Trial and License**: Free to try, with a one-time purchase for a license.

## Installing Necessary Tools

To effectively develop and test your web pages, you'll need a few additional tools:

### Web Browsers
- **Purpose**: Browsers are essential for viewing and testing your web pages. They render HTML and CSS, allowing you to see how your code appears to users.
- **Recommended Browsers**: Install multiple browsers for testing, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

### Live Server Extension
- **Purpose**: A live server extension allows you to run a local development server with live reload capability. This means you can see changes in your code reflected in the browser instantly.
- **Installation in VSCode**:
  1. Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
  2. Search for "Live Server" and click "Install."
  3. Once installed, you can start the server by right-clicking an HTML file and selecting "Open with Live Server."

### Example Setup Process

1. **Install VSCode**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install Browsers**: Download and install Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge from their respective websites.
3. **Set Up Live Server**:
   - Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view.
   - Search for "Live Server" and install it.
   - Open an HTML file and start the live server to see your changes in real-time.

By setting up your environment with a suitable code editor and necessary tools, you'll be well-equipped to start your journey in web development, making coding efficient and enjoyable.
