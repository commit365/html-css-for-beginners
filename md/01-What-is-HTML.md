# Lesson 1: What is HTML?

## Overview of HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage, allowing you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to annotate text and define the structure of web content.

### Key Features of HTML:
- **Tags and Elements**: HTML uses tags to create elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<p>` for a paragraph or `<h1>` for a heading.
- **Attributes**: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. For example, the `<img>` tag uses the `src` attribute to specify the image source.
- **Document Structure**: An HTML document typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections.

## Understanding the Role of HTML in Web Development

HTML is the backbone of web development. It defines the structure and content of a webpage, while other technologies like CSS and JavaScript handle styling and interactivity.

### Role of HTML:
- **Content Structure**: HTML organizes content into a hierarchical structure, making it easier for browsers to render and for users to navigate.
- **Semantic Meaning**: By using semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`), HTML provides meaning to the content, improving accessibility and SEO.
- **Foundation for Styling and Scripting**: HTML provides the base upon which CSS can style elements and JavaScript can add interactivity.

### Example of a Simple HTML Document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph explaining what HTML is.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- The `<html>` tag encloses the entire HTML document.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata, such as the page title.
- The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, and links.

By understanding HTML's role and structure, you can create well-organized and meaningful web pages that serve as the foundation for further styling and functionality.
