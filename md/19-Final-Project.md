# Lesson 19: Final Project

## Planning and Designing a Complete Website

The final project is an opportunity to apply all the skills and knowledge you've gained throughout this course. In this lesson, we will guide you through the process of planning, designing, and implementing a complete website. 

### Step 1: Define Your Website's Purpose

Before you start, determine the purpose of your website. Here are some common types of websites you might consider:

- **Personal Portfolio**: Showcase your skills, projects, and resume.
- **Blog**: Share your thoughts, experiences, or expertise on a particular topic.
- **Business Website**: Promote a product or service, providing information to potential customers.
- **Landing Page**: Focus on a single product or service, often used for marketing campaigns.

### Step 2: Plan Your Content

Outline the main sections and content of your website. Here’s a suggested structure for a personal portfolio website:

1. **Home**: Introduction and overview of who you are.
2. **About**: A detailed section about your background and skills.
3. **Portfolio/Projects**: Showcase your work with descriptions and links.
4. **Blog**: (Optional) Share articles or insights related to your field.
5. **Contact**: Provide ways for visitors to reach you (email, social media links).

### Step 3: Design Your Layout

Sketch a wireframe for your website to visualize the layout. This can be done on paper or using design tools like Figma or Adobe XD. Consider the following elements:

- **Header**: Logo, navigation menu, and a call-to-action.
- **Sections**: Clearly defined sections for each part of your content.
- **Footer**: Copyright information and additional links.

### Step 4: Choose a Color Scheme and Fonts

Select a color palette that reflects your personality or brand. Use tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate color schemes. Choose fonts that are easy to read and fit your website's style. Google Fonts is a great resource for free web fonts.

## Implementing Everything Learned in the Course

Now that you have a plan, it’s time to implement your website using the HTML and CSS skills you've learned.

### Step 5: Set Up Your Project Structure

Create a new folder for your project and set up the following structure:

```
my-portfolio/
│
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── portfolio.html
├── blog.html (optional)
├── contact.html
└── styles.css
```

### Step 6: Write Your HTML

Start by writing the HTML for each section of your website. Here’s an example of what your `index.html` might look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></li>
                <li><a href="blog.html">Blog</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="portfolio">
        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Description of project 1.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Description of project 2.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Portfolio</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 7: Style Your Website with CSS

Write the CSS in your `styles.css` file to style your website according to your design. Here’s an example of styling for your portfolio:

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px 0;
    text-align: center;
}

nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

section {
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
}

.project {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    margin: 10px 0;
    padding: 10px;
}

footer {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}
```

### Step 8: Test Your Website

Open your website in a web browser and test all links, styles, and functionality. Make sure it looks good on different screen sizes by resizing the browser window.

### Step 9: Deploy Your Website

Once you are satisfied with your website, you can deploy it online. You can use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to host your project for free.
